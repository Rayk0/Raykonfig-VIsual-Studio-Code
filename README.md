Here you can find everything that i use for Visual Studio Code, from extensions, to theme and font. But also what settings i like to enable.

## Theme
First of all, for my main VS Code Theme, I like to use [1mm Dracula Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joytrekker.1mm-themes). It has some fresh color vibes and great syntax highlighting.
